# YouTubeOnBackground
Open source software written for Android that lets you play Youtube videos in the background.

You can access a lot of music and videos on YouTube, but you can't play them in the background. It's okay because this open-source, development-oriented software can only link and run playlists, live feeds and videos on YouTube.
